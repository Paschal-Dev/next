        On your dashboard, you'll find two balances: one in USDT, representing
        stable currency, and the other in PWAT, stored as a token. While the
        USDT balance remains constant, the PWAT balance fluctuates based on the
        current token rate. You can easily track the total PWAT balance from
        your dashboard.
      </p>
      <p class="spaced">
        <strong>Opting to receive funds in PWAT:</strong> As a seller, storing
        funds solely in PWAT exposes you to potential value fluctuations. When
        spending PWAT on Peerwallet, you can choose to convert it or transfer it
        to another PWAT address, internally or externally.
      </p>
      <p class="spaced">
        <strong>Instant conversion:</strong> To convert PWAT to USDT on
        Peerwallet, you must first complete the conversion. Afterward, you can
        seamlessly spend on Peerwallet and other compatible marketplaces.
        Whether your funds are in USDT or PWAT, they remain readily liquid.
      </p>

        <strong>Balances top-up:</strong> When receiving funds via internal
        transfer from another Peerwallet user, they're typically sent in USDT.
        To replenish your primary wallet (USDT), you can add funds from the
        marketplace page. Alternatively, for PWAT wallet top-ups, you can
        directly do so from centralized exchanges or convert from USDT to PWAT
        on your dashboard, albeit with additional fees.
